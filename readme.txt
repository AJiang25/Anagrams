Anagrams is a fun game where 1 x 6 tiles of random letters appear where you
have a limited amount of time (80 seconds) to create as many words as you can
(3 letters and up). The score is the sum of all the individual word lengths in
the allotted time. Each word is fact checked using a Scrabble Words text file
to ensure that the word exists. When creating a word, after choosing one letter,
the option of the next letter is restricted to the remaining letters. One may
reshuffle the appearance of the letters. The highest score between two people
decides the winner of the game.
